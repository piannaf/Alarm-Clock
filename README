Alarm Clock Sample

To get a better understanding of the .NET framework and C#, I refactored out all the XAML from the original sample into pure C#. It is a direct port so uses WPF and follows the same structure of the original program.

Original: ~50%cpu, ~24megs RAM (84KB exe)
No XAML: ~50%cpu, ~24megs RAM (11KB exe)

The orignal program is copywrite Microsoft so I do not claim to hold the copywrite on this derived work. However, as this project was concieved for educational purposes, I assume to hold the right to distribute it.
